# tsfind

Extract code using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) queries.

Inspired by [helixbass/tree-sitter-grep](https://github.com/helixbass/tree-sitter-grep) which reports entire lines instead of just the captures.

Quite WIP, command line interface should be considered unstable - use at your own risk.
